# AzerothCore Interconnect
ACI allows you to connect your realms and Discords chats together so you can communication cross-boundary.

This means you can also connect totally separate servers together.

## Note
This module is a work in progress so expect crashes due to the TCP Client. If you run into any crashes please open an issue.
